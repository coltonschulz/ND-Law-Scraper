## Script Functions

### `get_title45_pdf_links()`

## Customization

```python
download_pdfs(unique_links, output_dir='my_custom_directory')
```

### Adjust Download Delay
Modify the `time.sleep()` value in the `download_pdfs()` function:
```python
time.sleep(1)  # Change to desired delay in seconds
```

### Extract Different Titles

```python
title45_url = "https://ndlegis.gov/information/acdata/html/title33.html"  # For Title 33
```

## Important Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è The script includes delays between requests to be respectful to the server
- üìã Not all articles may have PDF files available
- üîÑ The script automatically handles duplicate links
- üåê Requires an active internet connection

## Error Handling

The script handles common errors gracefully:
- Missing pages (404 errors)
- Network timeouts
- Invalid HTML structure
- File write permissions

Errors are logged to the console but won't stop the entire process.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- ‚úÖ This tool accesses publicly available information
- ‚úÖ Includes respectful delays between requests
- ‚úÖ Only downloads publicly accessible documents
- üìú All documents remain property of the State of North Dakota

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection Error" or "Timeout"
- Check your internet connection
- The website may be temporarily unavailable
- Try running the script again later

### "Permission Denied" when saving files
- Ensure you have write permissions in the current directory
- Try running with appropriate permissions or change the output directory

### No PDFs found
- The website structure may have changed
- Check if the Title 45 URL is still valid
- Verify the website is accessible in your browser
